## Origins

OFT's roots go back to the year 2003 when it's first predecessor with the unimaginative name Requirement Manager first saw the light of day at 3SOfT GmbH in Erlangen Tennenlohe (Germany). Being a software supplier for the automotive industry, 3SOFT had a need for requirement tracing to fulfill the strict rules for safety-critical software.

3SOFT was later acquired by the Finish Elektrobit group. And the Requirement Manager got a more sophisticated makeover in form of ReqM2. This had become necessary because the projects had become increasingly complex and required collecting coverage from multiple sub-modules. Bernd "Poldi" Haberstumpf improved the tracer over time. This led to the next incarnation dubbed "T-Reqs".

In even later projects performance became an issue, so the Perl-based T-Reqs was superceded by the much faster Allosaurus (yes, a this point in time everyone went full pun-mode).

While a lot faster, Allosaurus was somewhat clunky, and that was what started the development of OFT as a free software project. Christoph Pirkl and Sebastian BÃ¤r wrote OFT in their spare time while still working at Elekrobit with generous requirement engineering wisdom kindly supplied by Poldi.

Thomas Fleischmann was the main person to make OFT popular in the automotive industry, by tirelessly explaining its benefits to engineers and managers alike who were plagued by existing systems that were slow, proprietary and had terrible user experience.

## Free and Open Source

One thing was clear for the four original founders of OFT. This time we wanted a broader community around our requirement tracing suit. And, since we were convinced that there is a general need for requirement engineering in general and tracing in particular, we decided to start OpenFastTrace as an open source project on Github with the first commit in 2016. From then on OFT found its way into other industries outside of the automotive world and also into the build toolchains of other open source projects. And tha is the best thing we could ask for.
