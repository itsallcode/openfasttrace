# OpenFastTrace 3.7.0, released 2023-01-04

Code name: Improved console report and Typescript support

## Summary

In this release we added support for JavaScript (`js.`) and TypeScript files (`.ts`) to the `TagImporter`.

The plain text report (aka "console report") got an overhaul to improve readability. We added optional color and font formatting output.
We also reworked how the tracing results are presented in order to make the report more intuitive.

The new change log now has one file per version to make maintaining and reading it easier.
