# OpenFastTrace 3.8.0, released 2024-02-??

Code name: RST Importer

## Summary

Good news for our üêç Python friends: in this release we derived a parser for Restructured Text (RST) from our existing Markdown parser.

The Markdown parser in the process now accepts specification item titles underlined with either "=" (H1) or "-" (H2).

Also, the Markdown parser now ignores whitespace in `Needs` and `Tags` entries and correctly parses `Tags` at the start of a requirement item.

The test coverage for the Markdown importer is now at 100%, and we were able to remove tests that were done with mocks in favor or more robust low-level integration tests.

The HTML report now allows expanding all details sections with command line option `--details-section-display expand`.
