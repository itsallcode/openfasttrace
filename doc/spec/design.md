# Solution Ideas and Strategy

## Requirement tracing

The algorithm that checks the requirement links has to follow each link between requester and provider at least once.

Given:

  r<sub>n</sub>, n ∊ {1..N}

  p<sub>m</sub>, m ∊ {1..M}

  a<sub>n,l</sub>, l ∊ {1..L<sub>n</sub>}

  c<sub>m,k</sub>, k ∊ {1..M<sub>m</sub>}

Where _r_ are the requesters, _p_ the providers, _a_ artifacts required by providers and _c_ the coverage provided.

The number of forward links results to:

  f = Σ<sup>N</sup><sub>n = 1</sub> ( L<sub>n</sub> )

The number of backward links is:

  b = Σ<sup>M</sup><sub>n = 1</sub> ( K<sub>n</sub> )

### Lookups in the Naive Approach

The naive approach is to iterate over all required artifacts in all requesters and for each iterate over the complete set of providers to see if coverage exists.

If we assume a scenario where the coverage is 100% and a provider is found in average after iterating over half the providers this gives us the following number of Lookups _l_:

  l = f p / 2

Assuming that each requester needs to be covered by an average of _A_ artifacts we get:

  f = r A

  l = ( r  A ) p / 2

Assuming further that each provider has an average of _C_ back links to provide coverage we further get:

  p = r C

  l = ( r A ) ( r C ) / 2 = r² A C / 2

Note that _A_ and _C_ can be considered to have a small range in a typical project, depending only on the working style and not on the number of requirements the project need to handle.

In effect the lookup using the naive approach results in a complexity of O(n²). Not good.

### Lookups With an Index

If instead of relying on a linear search of all providers, we use an index. We saw earlier that iterating over the requesters results in a complexity of O(n). A proper index lookup should give O(log n) in the worst case. That leaves us with a complexity of O(n log(n)). Better.

### Choosing the Index

Since the specification item IDs inherently look similar, load tests need to show which kind of index is best balanced and has the optimal access time.

# Context

## Technical Constraints

## Conventions

# Building Block View

## Importers
For each specification artifact type OFT uses an importer. The importer uses the specification artifact as data source and reads specification items from it.

## Import Event Listener
Importers emit events if they find parts of a [specification item](#specification-item) in the artifact they are importing.

### Specification List Builder
The specification list builder is an import event listener that creates a list of specification items from import events.

## Command Line Interpreter
The command line interpreter (CLI) takes parameters given to OFT and parses them. It is responsible for making sense of the parameter contents and issuing help and error messages about the command line syntax.

## Linker
The linker is responsible for turning the imported [specification items](#specification-item) collected by the [importers](#importers) into [linked specification items](#linked-specification-item).

## Tracer
The tracer consumes the list of [linked specification items](#linked-specification-item) and evaluates the link status for each link.

## Reporter
The reporter consumes the link status list and the specification item list and generates a report in the chosen output format.

API users select reporters via their name as strings. This allows plugging in custom reporters in a loosely coupled fashion.

## Exporters
The exporter transforms the internal representation of [specification items](#specification-item) into the desired target format (e.g. Markdown).

API users select exporters via their name as strings.

# Runtime View

## Import

Depending on the source format a variety of [importers](#importers) takes care of reading the input [specification items](#specification-item). Each importer emits events which an [import event listener](#import-event-listener) consumes.

Common parts of the import like filtering out unnecessary items or attributes are handled by the listener.

### Selective Artifact Type Import

The most resource-friendly way to enable partial tracing is to ignore unnecessary data during import. This way less memory is used up and all subsequent steps are faster.

#### Filtering by Artifact Types During Import
`dsn~filtering-by-artifact-types-during-import~1`

When OFT is configured to restrict inclusion to one or more artifact types the [specification list builder](#specification-list-builder) imports the following elements only if they match at least one of the configured types:

1. "Needs coverage" markers
2. Specification items as a whole
3. Links covering items with this artifact type
4. Dependencies to item with this artifact type

Covers:

* `req~include-only-artifact-types~1`

Needs: impl, utest, itest

#### Filtering by Tags During Import
`dsn~filtering-by-tags-during-import~1`

The [specification list builder](#specification-list-builder) can be configured to import a specification item only if at least one of its tags is contained in the configured set of tags.

Covers:

* `req~include-items-where-at-least-on-tag-matches~1`

Needs: impl, utest, itest

#### Filtering by Tags or no Tags During Import
`dsn~filtering-by-tags-or-no-tags-during-import~1`

The [specification list builder](#specification-list-builder) can be configured to import a specification item only if it either has no tags or at least one of its tags is contained in the configured set of tags.

Needs: impl, utest, itest

## Tracing

### Tracing Needed Coverage
`dsn~tracing.needed-coverage-status~1`

The [linker](#linker) component iterates over all needed artifact types of all specification items and determines if and which coverage exists for each.

Comment:
Note that the linker only takes care of swallow coverage. [Deep coverage](#deep-coverage) is determined by the [tracer](#tracer) component.

Covers:

* `req~tracing.outgoing-coverage-link-status~1`

Needs: utest, impl

### Outgoing Coverage Link Status
`dsn~tracing.outgoing-coverage-link-status~3`

The [linker](#linker) component determines the coverage status of the outgoing link between the provider item and the requester item.

The possible results are:

  1. Covers:    link points to a specification item which wants this coverage
  2. Outdated:  link points to a specification item which has a higher revision number
  3. Predated:  link points to a specification item which has a lower revision number
  4. Ambiguous: link points to a specification item that has duplicates
  5. Orphaned:  link is broken - there is no matching coverage requester
  6. Unwanted:  coverage provider has an artifact type the provider does not want

Covers:

* `req~tracing.outgoing-coverage-link-status~1`

Needs: utest, impl

### Incoming Coverage Link Status
`dsn~tracing.incoming-coverage-link-status~1`

The [linker](#linker) component determines the coverage status of the incoming link between the requester item and the provider item.

The possible results are:

  1. Covered shallow:  coverage provider for a required coverage exists
  2. Covered unwanted: coverage provider covers an artifact type the requester does not want
  3. Covered predated: coverage provider covers a higher revision number than the requester has
  4. Covered outdated: coverage provider covers a lower revision number than the requester has

Covers:

* `req~tracing.incoming-coverage-link-status~1`

Needs: impl, utest

### Deep Coverage
`dsn~tracing.deep-coverage~1`

Covers:

* `req~tracing.deep-coverage~1`

Needs: impl, utest

### Duplicate Items
`dsn~tracing.tracing.duplicate-items~1`

The [tracer](#tracer) marks a [specification item](#specification-item) as a _duplicate_ if other items with an identical [specification item ID](#specification-item-id) exist.

Covers:

* `req~tracing.duplicate-items~1`

Needs: impl, utest

### Defect Items
`dsn~tracing.defect-items~2`

The [tracer](#tracer) marks a [specification item](#specification-item) as _defect_ if the following criteria apply to the item

    has duplicates
    or (not rejected
        and (any outgoing coverage link has a different status than "Covers"
             or not covered deeply
            )
       )

Covers:

* `req~tracing.defect-items~2`

Needs: impl, utest

### Link Cycle

# Concepts

## Data Structures

### Internal Data Structures

#### Specification Item
`dsn~specification-item~3`

A `SpecificationItem` consists of the following parts:

* ID (`SpecificationItemId`)
* Title (`String`, optional)
* Status (`Enum`, optional)
* Description (`String`, optional)
* Rationale (`String`, optional)
* Comment (`String`, optional)
* Source file + line (`String`, `int`, optional)
* Covers (List of `SpecificationItemId`, optional)
* Depends (List of `SpecificationItemId`, optional)
* Needs (List of `String`, optional)
* Tags (List of `String`, optional)
* Forwards (`boolean`, internal)

Comment:

See `req~forwarding_needed_coverage~1` for an explanation of the "forwards" fields meaning.

Covers:

* `req~specification-item~2`
* `req~forwarding_needed_coverage~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Linked Specification Item
`dsn~linked-specification-item~1`

A `LinkedSpecificationItem` is a container for a [SpecificationItem](#specification-item) that is enriched with references to other `LinkedSpecificationItem`s.

Rationale:
This allows navigating between specification items.

Covers:

* `req~specification-item~2`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Specification Item ID
`dsn~specification-item-id~1`

A `SpecificationItemId` consists of:

* Artifact type (String)
* name (String)
* revision (number)

Covers:

* `req~specification-item~2`

Needs: impl, utest

### Markdown-style Structures

#### Markdown Specification Item ID Format
`dsn~md.specification-item-id-format~2`

A requirement ID has the following format

    requirement-id = type "~" id "~" revision
    
    type = 1*ALPHA
    
    id = id-fragment *("." id-fragment)
    
    id-fragment = ALPHA *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-")
    
    revision = 1*DIGIT

Rationale:

The ID must only contain characters that can be used in URIs without quoting. This makes linking in formats like Markdown or HTML clean and easy.
Requirement type and revision must be immediately recognizable from the requirement ID. The built-in revision number makes links break if a requirement is updated - a desired behavior.

Comment:

Note that the artifact type is integral part of the ID. That means that `dsn~my-requirement~1` is something completely different then `utest~my-requirement~1`. One of the benefits of making the artifact type mandatory part of the ID is that this allows for typical coverage chains like.

    req~my-requirement~2 -> dsn~my-requirement~4 -> impl~my-requirement~4

Otherwise users would be forced to invent different names for each link in the chain.

Covers:

* `req~markdown-standard-syntax~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Markdown Specification Item Title
`dsn~md.specification-item-title~1`

If a Markdown title directly precedes a specification item ID, then the Markdown title is used as title for the specification item.

Rationale:

Markdown titles show up in the outline and are a natural way of defining a requirement title.

Covers:

* `req~markdown-standard-syntax~1`
* `req~markdown-outline-readable~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Markdown Requirement References
`dsn~md.requirement-references~1`

In Markdown specification item references have the following format:

    reference = (plain-reference / url-style-link)
    
    plain-reference = requirement-id
    
    url-style-link = "[" link-text "]" "(" "#" requirement-id ")"

Covers:

* `req~markdown-standard-syntax~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Markdown "Covers" list
`dsn~md.covers-list~1`

The Markdown Importer supports the following format for links that cover a different specification item.

    covers-list = covers-header 1*(LINEBREAK covers-line)
    
    covers-header = "Covers:" *WSP
    
    covers-line = *WSP "*" *WSP reference

Only one traced reference per line is supported. Any optional text after the reference is ignored if it is separated by at least one whitespace character

Rationale:

Defining a link should be as natural and simple as possible in Markdown. It must also be rendered correctly by a regular Markdown renderer without modifications. Embedding links in lists to define the relationship looks nice and is language independent.

Covers:

* `req~markdown-standard-syntax~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Markdown "Depends" List
`dsn~md.depends-list~1`

The Markdown Importer supports the following format for links to a different specification item which the current depends on.

    depends-list = depends-header 1*(LINEBREAK depends-line)
    
    depends-header = "Depends:" *WSP
    
    depends-line = *WSP "*" *WSP reference

Only one traced reference per line is supported. Any optional text after the reference is ignored if it is separated by at least one whitespace character

Rationale:

Defining a link should be as natural and simple as possible in Markdown. It must also be rendered correctly by a regular Markdown renderer without modifications. Embedding links in lists to define the relationship looks nice and is language independent.

Covers:

* `req~markdown-standard-syntax~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Markdown Compact "Needs" List
`dsn~md.needs-coverage-list-compact~1`

The Markdown Importer supports the following compact format for defining the list of artifact types that are needed to fully cover the current specification item.

    needs-list = needs-header 1*(LINEBREAK depends-line)

    needs-header = "Needs:" *WSP

    needs-line = *WSP "*" *WSP reference

Rationale:

This alternative style of the "needs" list provides backward compatibility to Elektrobit's legacy requirement enhanced Markdown format.

Covers:

* `req~markdown-standard-syntax~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Markdown Artifact Forwarding Notation
`dsn~md.artifact-forwarding-notation~1`

The Markdown Importer supports forwarding required coverage from one artifact type to one or more different artifact types using the following notation.

    artifact-need-redirection = skipped-artifact-type *WSP "-->" *WSP target-artifact-list
        *WSP ":" *WSP original-requirement-id
        
    skipped-artifact-type = artifact-type
    
    target-artifact-list = artifact-type *("," *WSP artifact-type)
        
    original-requirement-id = requirement-id

The following example shows an architectural specification item that forwards the needed coverage directly to the detailed design and an integration test.

    arch --> dsn, itest : req~skip-this-requirement~1
 
Covers:

* `req~artifact-type-forwarding-in-markdown~1`

Needs: impl, utest

### Elektrobit Markdown-style Structures

#### Markdown "Needs" List
`dsn~md.needs-coverage-list~2`

The Markdown Importer supports the following format for defining the list of artifact types that are needed to fully cover the current specification item.

    needs-list = "Needs:" *WSP reference *("," *WSP reference)

Rationale:

Unlike the the references to other requirements, tags are usually very short, so it is visually beneficial to use a compact style with a comma separated list in a single line.

Covers:

* `req~eb-markdown~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Legacy Markdown Specification Item ID Format
`dsn~md.eb-markdown-id~1`

Alternatively a Markdown requirement ID can have the following format

    requirement-id = *1(type~)type ":" id "," *WSP "v" revision

See `dsn~md.specification-item-id-format~2` for definitions of the ABNF sub-rules referred to here.

Rationale:

This ID format is supported for backwards compatibility with Elektrobit's legacy requirement-enhanced Markdown format.

Comment:

This format is deprecated. Please use the one specified in `dsn~md.specification-item-id-format~2` for new documents.

Covers:

* `req~eb-markdown~1`

Needs: impl, utest

### Coverage Tag Format

#### Full Coverage Tag Format
`dsn~import.full-coverage-tag~1`

OFT imports coverage tags in the full tag format:

    full-tag = "[" *WSP reference "->" requirement-id "]"

Covers:

* `req~import.full-coverage-tag-format~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Full Coverage Tag Format With Needed Coverage
`dsn~import.full-coverage-tag-with-needed-coverage~1`

OFT imports coverage tags in the full tag format with a list of required/needed artifact types:

    full-tag-with-needed-coverage = "[" *WSP reference *WSP "->" *WSP requirement-id
    *WSP ">>" *WSP artifact-type *WSP *("," *WSP artifact-type) "]"

Rationale:

The Tag importer is the catch all solution for all file formats that don't have a dedicated importer. We want to allow specification items imported via Tag importer to be intermediate nodes in the specification tree, instead of limiting them to leaves in the specification tree. Because leaves can only cover other specification items, but not require coverage.

Especially when used for design document files like UML models, requiring coverage is useful.

Covers:

* `req~import.full-coverage-tag-format~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Coverage Tag With Needed Coverage Generates Readable Names
`dsn~import.full-coverage-tag-with-needed-coverage-readable-names~1`

OFT generates readable names without hash code ID for tags with needed coverage.

Rationale:

When you need to cover these items it's important that the name is predictable and does not change e.g. when the file changes.

Covers:

* `req~import.full-coverage-tag-format~1`

Needs: impl, utest

#### Short Coverage Tag Format
`dsn~import.short-coverage-tag~1`

OFT imports coverage tags in the short tag format:

    short-tag = "[" "[" *WSP reference ":" *revision "]" "]"

During import of short tags OFT requires the following configuration:

* Path from which to import the tags
* Artifact type of the tags
* Artifact type of the covered specification item
* Name prefix of the covered specification item. The prefix is optional, default value: `project name "."`

Covers:

* `req~import.short-coverage-tag-format~1`

Needs: impl, utest

Covers:

* `req~cli.newline-format~1`

Needs: impl, itest

#### Default Newline Format
`dsn~cli.default-newline-format~1`

If the user does not specify the newline format as parameter, the exporter uses the native newline format of the platform OFT is executed on.

* `req~cli.default-newline-format~1`

Needs: impl, itest

### Requirement Tracing

#### Tracing Output Format
`dsn~cli.tracing.output-format~1`

The CLI accepts one of the following requirement tracing report formats as parameter:

    report-formats = "plain"

Covers:

* `req~cli.tracing.output-format~1`

Needs: impl, itest

The CLI uses ReqM2 as export format if none is given as a parameter.

Covers:

* `req~cli.conversion.default-output-format~1`

Needs: impl, itest, utest

# Design Decisions

## How do we Implement the Command Line Interpreter
`dsn~reflection-based-cli~1`

OFT got its own simple command line interpreter that uses reflection to feed the command line arguments to a receiver object.

Rationale:

One of the design goal of OFT is that it works without external runtime dependencies except for the Java Standard API. So taking an existing CLI was no option.
Using reflection allows the CLI user to implement the receiver as a POJO. No annotations are necessary.

Covers:

* `req~cli.tracing.command~1`
* `req~cli.conversion.command~1`

### Why is This Architecture Relevant?

Exchanging the CLI later takes considerable effort.

### Alternatives Considered

* No CLI (plain argument list) - not flexible enough
* External CLI - breaks design goal
